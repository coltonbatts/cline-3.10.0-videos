### Introduction (0:00 - 0:15)
"Managing your MCP servers just got a whole lot easier with Cline 3.10.0. In this video, we'll show you how the new MCP modal lets you quickly control your available tools directly from the chat interface."

### Feature Explanation (0:15 - 0:45)
"Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are a powerful way to extend Cline's capabilities, giving it access to external APIs, databases, and other tools. However, until now, managing these servers required navigating through settings files or configuration menus.

Cline 3.10.0 introduces a convenient new modal that's accessible directly from the chat input area. This modal allows you to easily view all your connected MCP servers and toggle them on or off with a single click. This means you can quickly control which tools are available to Cline without interrupting your workflow."

### Demo Setup (0:45 - 1:00)
"Let's see this in action. I have several MCP servers configured, including a weather API, a database connector, and a code analysis tool. I want to quickly enable just the tools I need for my current task."

### Demo Walkthrough (1:00 - 2:30)
