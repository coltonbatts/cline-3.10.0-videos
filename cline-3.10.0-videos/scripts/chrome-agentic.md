## Overview
This video demonstrates how Cline 3.10.0 can connect to a local Chrome browser to leverage existing logged-in sessions for automating tasks like writing tweets or updating project boards.

## Script

### Introduction (0:00 - 0:15)
"Cline 3.10.0 takes automation to the next level. In this video, we'll show you how Cline can now connect to your active Chrome session to interact with web applications using your existing logins—no more session limitations."

### Feature Explanation (0:15 - 0:45)
"One of the most powerful new features in Cline 3.10.0 is the ability to connect directly to your local Chrome browser through remote debugging. This means Cline can now leverage your existing authenticated sessions to interact with web applications.

Previously, Cline used a sessionless browser that couldn't access your logged-in state. Now, Cline can work with your active sessions to draft emails, update project boards, or even post tweets for you—all while using your existing authentication."

### Demo Setup (0:45 - 1:00)
"Let's see this in action. I'm already logged into Twitter in my Chrome browser, and I've enabled remote debugging. Cline is configured to connect to this Chrome instance."

### Demo Walkthrough (1:00 - 2:30)
