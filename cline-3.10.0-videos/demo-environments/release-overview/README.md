# Release Overview Demo Environment

This folder contains a demo environment for creating the Cline 3.10.0 Release Overview video, which will showcase all the key features of the release in a montage format.

## Overview

The Release Overview video will be a comprehensive montage highlighting all the major features in Cline 3.10.0, including:

1. Chrome Integration (debugging, agentic tasks, private content extraction)
2. YOLO Mode
3. Drag and Drop
4. MCP Modal
5. Under-the-hood improvements

## Audio Narration

The audio narration has already been recorded with ElevenLabs using the following script:

```
Cline 3.10.0 is HERE.

bringing powerful new ways to enhance your development workflow. 

The headline feature? Direct integration with your local Chrome browser.

By connecting to your Chrome via remote debugging, Cline now operates within your real browser environment-using your logins, cookies, and session state.

This unlocks seamless debugging of your web applications, session-based automation of your favorite tools, and access to private content that was previously off-limits.

For maximum productivity, we've introduced yolo Modeâ€”enabling Cline to run completely autonomously without requiring approval for each action. Perfect for large refactors or complex tasks, but remember to use with caution.

We've also streamlined your everyday workflow with drag-and-drop file context, quick MCP server management directly from the chat, and under-the-hood optimizations like prompt caching and reduced system prompts.

Update your Cline extension today to experience these powerful new features. Check out our documentation for detailed setup guides and join our community to share your innovative workflows. 

Cline 3.10.0

elevating your development experience to the next level.
